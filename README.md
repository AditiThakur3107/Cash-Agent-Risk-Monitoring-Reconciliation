This project implements a fully synthetic end-to-end Cash Agent system designed for transaction risk monitoring and reconciliation. It identifies suspicious transaction patterns using rule-based logic and optional ML scoring, simulates stakeholder feedback to refine rules, and performs automatic credit–debit reconciliation with fallback matching for unresolved entries. The system demonstrates how financial processes such as risk detection, rule tuning, and reconciliation can be automated
